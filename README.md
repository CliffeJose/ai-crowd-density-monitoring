# AI-Based Crowd Density & Risk Zone Monitoring System

This project is an AI-powered crowd monitoring system built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
It detects people in crowd videos, analyzes crowd density, and identifies risky zones
using intelligent zone-based monitoring.

## Features
- People detection using YOLOv8
- Crowd density heatmap visualization
- Zone-based crowd analysis (4 zones)
- Intelligent risk classification (Safe / Moderate / Dangerous)
- Zone-wise crowd data logging
- Dataset/video-based analysis (professional approach)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Place a crowd video inside the `Videos` folder
2. Update video path in `main.py` if needed
3. Run:
python main.py


## Use Cases
- Smart city crowd monitoring
- Mall and station congestion analysis
- Public safety and risk zone detection
